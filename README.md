# OwnLocalBackendProject

This program will use the Ruby on Rails API MVC format. The following Ruby on Rails installation instructions were obtained from http://api.rubyonrails.org. 

###Getting Started

1. Install Rails at the command prompt if you haven't yet:

	`gem install rails`

2. At the command prompt, create a new Rails application:

	`rails new myapp`

   where “myapp” is the application name.

3. Change directory to myapp and start the web server:

	`cd myapp; rails server`

	Run with --help or -h for options.

4. Go to localhost:3000 and you'll see:

	`"Welcome aboard: You're riding Ruby on Rails!"`
